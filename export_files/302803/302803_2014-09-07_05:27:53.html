This is your second notice. If you do not make a payment in the amount=
 of $114.49 today, another automatic payment in the amount of $114.49=
 will be initiated within 2 days of this notice. Please make sure your=
 bank account has sufficient funds to cover this payment to avoid furthe=
r fees.

If payment is not received:=20
- You will be charged a late fee of $15.00 after 15 days past due;
- Your loan will be sent to our collection agents after 15 days past due;
- Your delinquency will be reported to the credit reporting agencies if=
 your loan goes more than 30 days past due. DO NOT RUIN YOUR CREDIT!
